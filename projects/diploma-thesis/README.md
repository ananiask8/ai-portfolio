# PRIOR MODELS FOR ROBUST ADVERSARIAL DEEP LEARNING
###### Jos√© Hilario

Deep networks learned by standard methods of discriminative learning are susceptible to adversarial patterns. Training adversarially robust deep networks therefore requires new learning methods. One interesting option is to include appropriate prior knowledge that will either generalize in a stronger sense by using prior information, or restrict the search space explored by the learning method while, after training, penalizing examples that are unlikely under the data distribution.

The thesis aims at analyzing and comparing different types of prior knowledge with respect to their impact on adversarial robustness. A suitable option for convolutional deep networks is to introduce lateral interactions within the convolutional layers to reflect the assumption of spatial continuity.

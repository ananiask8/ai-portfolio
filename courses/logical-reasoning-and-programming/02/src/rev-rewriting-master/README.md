# Reversible Term Rewriting

A tool written in Prolog for the transformation of an irreversible Term Rewriting System into a reversible one.

### Dependencies

This tool uses the [tokenize library](https://github.com/aBathologist/tokenize).
You do not need to install it since it is already included on the project.

### How to use

First, load the rules from the *rev.pl* script as usual:
```
?- [rev].
```
Then, call the main rule (`fscd/1`) with the path to your .trs file (an atom).

For instance, to use the example TRS [AProVE webpage](http://aprove.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/help_new/trs.html#trs):
```
?- fscd('examples/ackermann.trs').
```
The program will start its execution and print the transformed systems at each step.

### Publications

This tool is an implementation of the proposed transformations in the following publications:
